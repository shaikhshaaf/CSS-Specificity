<!-- Equal specificity: the latest rule counts - If the same rule is written twice
 into the external style sheet, then the lower rule in the style sheet is closer to
  the element to be styled, and therefore will be applied:
 -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
h1 {background-color: yellow;}
h1 {background-color: red;}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is heading 1</h1>

</body>
</html>

<!-- ID selectors have a higher specificity than attribute selectors - 
Look at the following three code lines:

 -->


 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
div#a {background-color: green;}
#a {background-color: yellow;}
div[id=a] {background-color: blue;}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div id="a">This is a div</div>

</body>
</html>
